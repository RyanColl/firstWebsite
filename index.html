                    When I was in grade 7, on my own time, I was learning about all the different things NASA was doing in outer space.
                    My fascination and love for space and all things wild brought me to a quantum physics book in grade 8.
                    From there, I read <strong>Michio Kaku</strong>, <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong>, and of course some of <strong>Einstein's</strong> works on relativity.
                    I love the stuff, although lately I have been so busy with work and life during COVID-19, that I have not been able 
                    to look at it for some time now. Also, the last time I took school was in 2017, so my math skills need some brushing up on.
                    I notice this in the day to day math we have to do for this course, but everything else I feel very confident in. 
                    I guess thats what office hours are for! I look forward to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer!
                    <em>P.S I just got a new kitten, 6 months old, and sometimes she jumps on the desk and unplugs my USB drive, or attacks my LAN cable!
                    P.S.S. She is so cute tho, how could I be mad?</em>
